"""Bidirectional model interface for real-time streaming conversations.

Defines the interface for models that support bidirectional streaming capabilities.
Provides abstractions for different model providers with connection-based communication
patterns that support real-time audio and text interaction.

Features:
- connection-based persistent connections
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Provider-agnostic event normalization  
- Tool execution integration
