# Subagents: A Vended `use_agent` Tool

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2026-08-12

**Issue**: TBD

**Scope**: Python SDK first; the same shape ports to the TypeScript SDK later.

**Related**:
- [#3392: `use_agent` delegation shim](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/3392) — draft, parked pending this design pass
- [#3346: agent-as-tool delegation (`delegate=True`)](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/3346) — open, overlaps with the extraction protocol below

- [#3499: tool parameter named `agent` is silently dropped](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/issues/3499) — open

## Context

We want `use_agent` — model-driven delegation, where the model can shape the child's instructions, tools, and model at call time — in the SDK as a vended tool. `Agent.as_tool()` stays as the primitive for developer-authored children; this covers the model-authored side. [#3392](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/3392) is a first cut and is parked pending this design.

A straight port of `strands_tools.use_agent` is not the answer. Three problems have to be fixed on the way in, and two of them are SDK problems, not tool problems.

## Problem

**1. One fixed parameter list cannot serve every harness.** A regulated harness wants the child's prompt and tools fixed and reviewed, with the model supplying only the task. A coding harness wants named roles the model picks from. A research harness wants ad-hoc roles, a model-tier choice, and some forked context. Whatever fixed list we vend, someone forks a semver-bound tool to add or remove a parameter.

**2. The result has no contract.** Every delegation path — `_agent_as_tool.py`, `strands_tools.use_agent`, #3392 — returns `str(result)`: interrupts, else structured output, else the text of the child's *final message*, plus (in the tools-repo version) a metrics dump as prose. There is no declared shape, no machine-readable usage, and no handle to the child, so anything the parent needs beyond the final text — a structured report, token accounting, a way to follow up — has no place to live. One known edge case that falls out of "final message only": a plugin that re-invokes the child (e.g. `GoalLoop`) makes the final message a follow-up rather than the deliverable; v1 treats that as an edge case (a warning plus `result_model`, below), with configurable extraction as future work.

**3. The child is not a member of the harness.** `strands_tools.use_agent` and #3392 both construct a bare `Agent(...)` — no sandbox, no interventions, no skills. In a harness that gates `shell` in `BeforeToolCall`, delegation is a structural bypass of the gate. Every implementation that got this right (strandly, stan, Codex) builds the child through the same construction path as the parent.

Two smaller points. Both tools are one blocking call returning text with no handle, so adding wait/resume/cancel later is a breaking change to a vended tool. And the tools-repo `use_agent` carries defects that must not be ported — `model_provider`/`model_settings` as a credential-injection surface, silent fallback to the parent's model, synchronous invocation, a metrics dump in the parent's context ([Appendix C](#appendix-c); #3392 already cuts most of them).

## Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

- One vended tool spanning "model supplies only a task" to "model supplies everything", configured, not forked — with the model-facing schema derived from that configuration and inspectable.
- Children built through the harness's construction path, inheriting sandbox and policy by default.
- `make_use_agent()` with no arguments ≈ #3392's surface; the result shape and factory signature reserve the seams — a handle, an extraction hook, plugin inheritance — so later extensions stay additive.

Non-Goals (v1): background execution, parallel fan-out (that's `swarm`/`graph`, [#3380](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/3380)), cross-process sessions, replacing `as_tool`, configurable output extraction, and plugin inheritance (see Future Work).

## Prior Art

| Implementation | Child identity authored by | Model may set | What comes back |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) `spawn_agent` | Developer (roles in `agents.toml` + `agents/` dirs, layered) | `message`, `agent_type`, `fork_turns`, `model`, `reasoning_effort` — **each removable by config** | `{agent_id}`; content fetched via `wait_agent` |
| [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) `task` | Developer (agent definition files) | `description`, `prompt`, `subagent_type`, `task_id`, `background` | Last text part in a `<task_result>` envelope |
| Claude Code `Task` | Developer (subagent files, five scopes) | `description`, `prompt`, `subagent_type` | The child's report |
| [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) `as_tool` | Developer (an instance) | `input`, or a supplied Pydantic type | `custom_output_extractor` (default: last message, documented as such) |
| [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python) `AgentTool` | Developer | Derived from child's input schema | `skip_summarization` toggle |
| `strands_tools.use_agent` | **Model** | `prompt`, `system_prompt`, `tools`, `model_provider`, `model_settings` | Response + model id + metrics, as text |

Three takeaways. **Named developer-authored roles won everywhere**; model-authored system prompts are at most a secondary path. **Everyone has an extraction knob except us** — and Codex's current protocol goes furthest: `wait_agent` returns no content at all, only which children have updates. **Codex derives the spawn tool's schema from configuration**, literally `properties.remove("model")` per option flags ([Appendix B](#appendix-b)) — which settles that defect 1 is solvable with a shipping mechanism, not a research idea. Our own `make_sleep(max_duration=...)` already derives the *description* from config; this extends that to parameters. Extended matrix in [Appendix D](#appendix-d).

## Proposal

### Recommended: a factory whose tool schema follows its configuration

Vend `make_use_agent(...)` plus a pre-configured `use_agent` default instance, per the vended-tool convention. The new part: configuration determines *which parameters exist*. A subagent needs five things — instructions, tools, model, context, budget — and for each the developer says who decides it:

| Authority | Meaning | Effect on the tool schema |
|---|---|---|
| `Open(max_bytes=...)` | Model writes the value freely | Adds a string parameter |
| `Choice(...)` | Model picks from a developer-supplied set | Adds an enum parameter; options described in the tool description |
| `Narrow(allow=...)` | Model may only *remove* from a set, never add | Adds an array parameter with enum items |
| `Fixed(value)` | Developer decides | No parameter |
| `Inherit()` | Take the parent's value | No parameter |

`Narrow` is the only mode safe by construction — a child can never gain a capability the parent lacked (opencode enforces the same property by deriving child permissions from the parent's, then adding denies). The regulated harness and the research harness are now the same code path with different `inputSchema`s, and the developer can print the schema to see exactly what the model was handed:

```python
from strands.vended_tools.use_agent import make_use_agent, Fixed, Choice, Open, Narrow, Inherit

locked = make_use_agent(
    presets={"reviewer": reviewer, "researcher": researcher},
    instructions=Fixed(None),   # roles own the prompt; parameter removed
    tools=Fixed(None),          # roles own the tools; parameter removed
    model=Inherit(),            # parameter removed
    context=Fixed("none"),      # parameter removed
)
sorted(locked.tool_spec["inputSchema"]["json"]["properties"])
# ['agent_type', 'task']
```

Full signature in [Appendix A](#appendix-a). Five parts complete the design:

**Named presets.** A `Preset` is a partially applied configuration — instructions, tools, model, budget, result contract — registered under a name; passed as a mapping, a directory of definition files, or `Skill` objects. When presets exist, the tool gains an `agent_type` enum and the description lists each role. Definition files are skill-shaped, so one dialect describes both top-level and delegated agents (opencode's `mode: subagent | primary | all`). Ad-hoc `instructions=Open(...)` stays available and is the vended default, for continuity with today's `use_agent`.

**Construction through an injected builder.** The tool resolves config plus the model's arguments into an `AgentSpec` and hands it to an `AgentBuilder`. The default builder is roughly #3392's body; a harness passes its own, and the child is built the way the parent was — same sandbox, same interventions, same skills. This is the fix for defect 3, and it is Codex's split too: discovery resolves the invocation, the runtime only starts it, the host injects the spawn capability.

```python
class AgentBuilder(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, spec: AgentSpec, *, parent: Agent) -> Agent: ...
```

The default builder does not copy the parent's plugins into the child; a harness builder decides what the child runs. Filtered plugin inheritance is future work.

**Declared output, not `str(result)`.** v1 keeps today's extraction — interrupts, else structured output, else the final message's text — with one addition: if the child ran more than one invocation (a plugin re-invoked it; the edge case from defect 2) the tool logs a loud warning. The stronger option is `result_model: type[BaseModel]`, which constructs the child with `structured_output_model=` — an existing `Agent` parameter — so the parent receives fields (`{summary, findings, files_changed, open_questions}`) instead of "whichever message was last". Opt-in per preset, since it constrains the child. A general `output_extractor` hook is future work, deferred so it lands once as a protocol shared with `as_tool`/`swarm`/`graph`; adding it later is purely additive. The tool's own result is declared via `outputSchema`:

```python
{"agent_id": str,          # handle, so wait/resume/cancel stay additive later
 "status": "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "interrupted",
 "output": str | dict,     # final text; dict when result_model is set
 "truncated": bool, "artifact": str | None,   # offload target when over max_output_bytes
 "usage": {"input_tokens": int, "output_tokens": int},
 "execution_time_ms": int}
```

Deliberately absent: the model id and the metrics prose. Usage is a field and a trace attribute, not conversation content.

**Context inheritance as a dial.** `context` takes `"none" | "all" | N` turns (Codex's `fork_turns`), replacing `as_tool`'s boolean and `use_agent`'s implicit always-none. A reviewer that sees the last three turns beats one re-briefed in prose; a researcher should start clean. As an axis it can be fixed or offered to the model like the others.

**Per-run budgets, structural depth.** `max_depth`, `max_children`, `max_concurrency`, `wall_clock_s`, `max_task_bytes` are accounted per *run* — per-call caps are defeated by calling twice. Depth is structural: at the limit the child is built *without* the delegation tool, so recursion is impossible rather than discouraged (opencode's `childToolDenies` does the same). Budget exhaustion returns `{"status": "failed", ...}` as a tool result, not an exception, so the model can adapt.

**Pros:**

- One tool spans every harness posture; the model-facing surface is a deployment decision, inspectable by printing a schema.
- `make_use_agent()` ≈ #3392, so this is additive, not competing.
- Children built through the harness's own path inherit sandbox and policy; the result is data with a handle, not prose.
- Composes existing SDK features — `ModelRouter` candidates, `structured_output_model`, the dynamic `tool_spec` setter, `outputSchema` — rather than adding mechanism.

**Cons:**

- Five exported names (`Open`, `Choice`, `Fixed`, `Inherit`, `Narrow`) is real conceptual weight for one tool.
- A schema that varies by configuration is harder to document and benchmark; the common configurations need to ship as documented presets.
- v1 ships without configurable extraction and without plugin inheritance; `result_model` and the multi-invocation warning cover the known edge case until the extractor hook lands.
- The *default* builder still constructs a plain agent — harness membership arrives only when a harness passes its builder. Correctness by convention there, not construction.

### Alternative: ship #3392 as it stands

Fixed three-parameter tool; harnesses needing more write their own. **Pros:** written, small, ships in days. **Cons:** keeps all three defects and has no handle in the result. **Verdict:** not wrong, incomplete — adopt it as the factory's *default configuration* instead.

### Alternative: fixed schema plus a permissions object

Keep six parameters; validate the model's arguments against a developer policy at call time. **Pros:** one schema to document, no derived-schema machinery. **Cons:** the model sees parameters it may not use and finds out by being refused — wasted turns, wasted prompt budget on every request. Codex started near this and moved to removing the properties. **Verdict:** telling the model less beats telling it more and saying no.

### Alternative: ship the full lifecycle now

Five tools — spawn, wait, send input, resume, close (Codex's shape). **Pros:** most capable; parallelism and follow-ups come free. **Cons:** five tools of surface and concurrency semantics before one blocking call works well; parents must be taught not to poll. **Verdict:** v1 blocks; the reserved `agent_id` keeps this path open, and opencode shows most of it can arrive later as two parameters on one tool.

### Alternative: `as_tool` only

**Pros:** one existing primitive. **Cons:** no model-chosen roles, nothing varies per call, and it has the same result-contract gap. **Verdict:** answers a different question; both should exist.

## Developer Experience

### Minimal: the vended default

```python
from strands.vended_tools import use_agent

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[shell, file_editor, use_agent])
```

Model may write ad-hoc instructions and narrow the tool set; child inherits the model, starts fresh. Today's behavior, deliberately.

<details>
<summary>Resulting tool schema</summary>

```json
{
  "name": "use_agent",
  "description": "Delegate a self-contained task to a subagent. The subagent starts with no knowledge of this conversation, so the task must contain everything it needs. It runs your current model and returns a final report. Do not poll for progress or duplicate the subagent's work.",
  "inputSchema": {"json": {

### Typical: named roles in a harness

```python
use_agent = make_use_agent(
    presets=Path(".strands/agents"),   # reviewer.md, researcher.md, test_writer.md
    instructions=Fixed(None),
    tools=Fixed(None),
    model=Inherit(),
    builder=my_harness.build_agent,
    max_depth=2,
    max_children=8,
)
```

A role definition — a skill with two extra fields:

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews a diff for correctness, API fit, and test coverage.
tools: [shell, file_editor]
model: deep
result_model: ReviewReport
---
You are a senior reviewer. Read the diff, then ...
```

<details>
<summary>Resulting tool schema (two parameters; roles listed in the description)</summary>

```json
{
  "name": "use_agent",
  "description": "Delegate a task to a specialized subagent.\n\nAvailable subagents:\n- reviewer: reviews a diff for correctness, API fit, and test coverage (tools: shell, file_editor)\n- researcher: answers questions about external sources (tools: http_request)\n- test_writer: writes and runs tests (tools: shell, file_editor)",
  "inputSchema": {"json": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "task":       {"type": "string", "description": "The self-contained task for the subagent."},
      "agent_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["reviewer", "researcher", "test_writer"]}
    },
    "required": ["task", "agent_type"]
  }}
}
```

</details>

### Maximal: a research harness

```python
use_agent = make_use_agent(
    instructions=Open(16 * 1024),
    tools=Narrow(),
    model=Choice(router),              # named candidates from a ModelRouter
    context=Choice(["none", "all", 3]),
    builder=my_harness.build_agent,
    allow_resume=True,
)
```

<details>
<summary>Resulting tool schema</summary>

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "task":         {"type": "string"},
    "instructions": {"type": "string"},
    "tools":        {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["shell", "file_editor", "http_request"]}},
    "model":        {"type": "string", "enum": ["fast", "balanced", "deep"],
                     "description": "fast: cheap, short tasks. balanced: the default. deep: hard reasoning, slower and costlier. Omit to inherit the caller's model."},
    "context":      {"type": "string", "enum": ["none", "all", "3"],
                     "description": "How much of this conversation the subagent can see. More context costs more tokens."},
    "session":      {"type": "string",
                     "description": "A prior agent_id. Continues that subagent's session instead of starting a fresh one."}
  },
  "required": ["task"]
}
```

</details>

The `model` axis consumes `ModelRouter` candidates — developer-named tiers over real `Model` instances — so the tool never touches provider strings or credentials.

### Errors

Budget/depth exhaustion is a tool result (`{"status": "failed", "output": "Subagent budget exhausted: 8 of 8 children used in this run."}`) so the model can adapt. At the depth limit the child simply lacks the tool (`child.tool_names` has no `use_agent`). Configuration errors raise at factory time, per the `make_sleep` precedent:

```python
>>> make_use_agent(tools=Choice([]))
ValueError: tools=Choice([]) offers no options; use Fixed(None) to remove the parameter.
```

## Consequences

Easier: a harness gets a posture-matched subagent tool from configuration; "what can my model do?" is answered by printing a schema; children inherit sandbox and policy; the result is a declared shape with a handle, so lifecycle tools and future extensions stay additive.

Needs attention:

- **A configurable schema is harder to document and evaluate** — ship the three configurations above as documented, tested presets.
- **The default builder constructs a plain agent.** Consider refusing to run when the parent has a sandbox the default builder can't pass on, rather than quietly building a child without one.
- **`context="all"` vs conversation managers and session state** is untraced; needs a pass before that value is offered to a model.
- **`Fixed` vs `Inherit` may be redundant** — both remove the parameter, differing only in where the value comes from.

Migration: nothing breaks. `strands_tools.use_agent` keeps working (migration note: `model_provider`/`model_settings` → `ModelRouter` candidates, not a passthrough). `as_tool` is untouched.

## Development Plan

- **Phase 0 (one PR):** multiagent conventions as code — depth counter, per-run budget accounting, status vocabulary (today a convention doc duplicated across #3392 and #3380 with colliding exports).
- **Phase 1 (v1):** the factory — axes, presets, injected builder, `result_model`, context dial, per-run budgets, declared result with `agent_id`, the multi-invocation warning. Default extraction only; no plugin inheritance. Blocking but streaming and cancellable. #3392 becomes the default configuration.
- **Later:** the Future Work items below, each as its own design or PR.

Prototype phase 1 in strandly first — `build_agent` and role files already exist there — before any of it becomes public API.

## Future Work

Reserved by the v1 surface, intentionally not designed here:

- **Configurable output extraction** — an `output_extractor` hook, landed once as a protocol shared with `as_tool`, `swarm`, and `graph` so the four paths don't diverge. This is also the proper fix for the re-invocation edge case in defect 2. One coordination point that can't wait: [#3346](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/3346)'s `delegate=True` should not hard-code `str(result)`, or the hook can't be added cleanly later.
- **Plugin inheritance** — `inherit_plugins`, gated on a way for plugins to declare themselves top-level-only. Until then the default builder passes no plugins and harness builders decide.
- **Lifecycle** — `session`/resume against the reserved `agent_id`; background execution as a transport on the spec; `define_agent` for runtime role registration.

## Open Questions

1. **`result_model` in v1?** Recommendation: yes, opt-in per preset — it rides on the existing `structured_output_model`, no new primitive.
2. **Resume in v1?** Recommendation: no — reserve `agent_id`, ship `session` later.
3. **Five authority modes or three?** `Fixed`/`Inherit` may collapse — both remove the parameter, differing only in where the value comes from.
4. **Should the vended default expose ad-hoc `instructions`?** Recommendation: yes, for continuity with today's `use_agent`; presets documented as the recommended posture.
5. **#3346 coordination** — needs a comment before it merges so `delegate` doesn't hard-code `str(result)`.

## Willingness to Implement

Yes — phase 0 and v1, prototyped in an internal harness first.

<summary><b>Appendix B: How Codex derives its spawn schema from configuration</b></summary>

From `codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/multi_agents_spec.rs` in [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex):

```rust
pub struct SpawnAgentToolOptions {
    pub available_models: Vec<ModelPreset>,
    pub agent_type_description: String,
    pub expose_agent_type: bool,
    pub hide_agent_type_model_reasoning: bool,
    pub expose_spawn_agent_model_overrides: bool,
    pub multi_agent_version: MultiAgentVersion,
    pub usage_hint_text: Option<String>,
}

let mut properties = spawn_agent_common_properties_v2(&options.agent_type_description);
if !options.expose_agent_type              { properties.remove("agent_type"); }
if options.hide_agent_type_model_reasoning { properties.remove("service_tier"); }
if !options.expose_spawn_agent_model_overrides {
    properties.remove("model");
    properties.remove("reasoning_effort");
}
```

Points that map onto this design:

- **Parameters appear and disappear per configuration.** This is the authority-mode idea, without the vocabulary.
- **The description is composed from configuration** — the available model menu is interpolated, along with guidance that spawned agents inherit the caller's model by default. Our `sleep_description(max_duration)` is the same convention at a smaller scale.
- **`agent_type` resolves against a catalog** built from `agents.toml` roles plus an `agents/` directory, per configuration layer, warning on duplicate role names within a layer. This is our `presets`, and it is also what Claude Code and opencode do.
- **The tools declare output schemas** — `{agent_id, nickname}` for spawn, and a per-agent status union for wait. Ours should too.
- **The surface is explicitly versioned** (`MultiAgentVersion`, with v1 and v2 exposing different parameters), because they expected to break it. Reserving `agent_id` is how we try to avoid needing that.
- **Construction is split from resolution.** The runtime receives a fully resolved invocation and the code comments that discovery owns rendering the prompt while the runtime only starts it in a forked context. The host injects the spawn capability through a trait. That is `AgentSpec` plus an injected builder.
- **A child receives a whole configuration**, not a bare agent — the argument for builder injection.

Two hygiene details worth copying: Codex encrypts the child's task payload, and OpenAI's structured-input preamble instructs the model to treat a schema as data rather than instructions.

2. **Silent fallback to the parent's model.** Three separate `except` paths reassign the child's model to the parent's. The model asks for something cheap, gets something expensive, and only a debug log records it.
3. **The child is invoked synchronously.** No `await`, no cancellation, no streaming. A long-running child blocks the loop and produces no output until it finishes.
4. **Three text blocks come back** — the response, the model id, and a formatted metrics dump — and all three enter the parent's conversation on every call.
5. **`tools=None` inherits the entire parent registry**, with no depth limit, no output cap, and no allowlist validation beyond a warning for unknown names.
6. **No membership.** The child is a bare `Agent`, so any policy the harness enforces through hooks does not apply to it.

Worth keeping: the idea of a per-call model choice (as a name, not a provider configuration), and returning usage information (as data, not prose).

### Context inheritance and lifecycle

| Implementation | Context inheritance | Lifecycle | Child inherits harness policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex `spawn_agent` | `fork_turns`: `"none"`, `"all"`, or a turn count | Five tools: spawn, wait, send input, resume, close. Spawn returns only an id | Yes — the child is a forked thread with the full configuration |
| opencode `task` | Fresh, or a resumed session via `task_id` | One tool plus `background` and `task_id` | Yes — permissions derived from the parent, then narrowed |
| Claude Code `Task` | Fresh | One blocking call | Yes |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `session` / `conversation_id` | One call; `max_turns` per tool | Run config, hooks, and approval settings per tool |
| Google ADK | Session state | One call | — |
| `strands_tools.use_agent` | None | One blocking call | No |
| `Agent.as_tool()` | `preserve_context: bool` | One call; interrupts propagate | Whatever the wrapped instance has |

### Output extraction, specifically

| Implementation | Extraction surface | Default |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `as_tool(custom_output_extractor=...)` | The agent's last message, documented as such |
| Google ADK | `AgentTool(skip_summarization=...)` | Summarize |
| opencode | Last text part, in a `<task_result>` envelope | Last text part |
| Codex (earlier protocol) | `wait_agent` returns the final message per agent id | Final message |
| Codex (current protocol) | `wait_agent` returns no content, only which agents have updates | Nothing; the parent must ask |
| Strands | `str(result)` | Final message text |

### Our own harnesses

Two internal harnesses independently arrived at the same shape and are the strongest evidence for this design.

One builds subagents through the harness's own `build_agent` function, selects models by tier name rather than model id, defines roles as files, streams the child's work as it happens — and gates four plugins on "am I a subagent?" — the experience behind this design's choice to leave plugin inheritance out of v1.

The other forwards the parent's full configuration into the child through an injected builder, exposes exactly one role, takes `task` as its only parameter, and returns `str(result)`. It is the minimal correct version of this tool, and it is what `presets` with a single entry should produce.

**Verified against `harness-sdk` at `main` while writing this document:**

| Claim | Location |
|---|---|
| `as_tool(name, description, preserve_context)`; no `delegate` parameter yet | `agent/agent.py:1005` |
| `AgentResult.__str__` returns interrupts, then structured output, then the final message's text | `agent/agent_result.py:61-91` |
| Agent-as-tool extraction uses structured output if present, else `str(result)` | `agent/_agent_as_tool.py:220-233` |
| `Agent(structured_output_model=...)` exists, making `result_model` a one-line change | `agent/agent.py:188` |
| `RoutingCandidate(model, name, description)` — named model candidates already exist | `models/routing/router.py:74` |
| `Plugin` has `name`, `hooks`, `tools`, `init_agent`, and no scope concept | `plugins/plugin.py` |
| Tool specs may be replaced at runtime, explicitly to support dynamic configuration | `tools/decorator.py:551` |
| `ToolSpec.outputSchema` exists as an optional field | `types/tools.py:38` |
| Vended-tool convention: `make_sleep(...)`, a module-level default instance, and a description derived from configuration | `vended_tools/sleep/{sleep,types}.py` |
| A resume starts a full new invocation cycle | `vended_plugins/goal/plugin.py`, `hooks/events.py` |
| PR/issue states: #3392 open draft, #3346 open and unmerged, #3380 open draft, #3499 open | GitHub API |

**External sources**, read as source rather than documentation: `openai/codex` (`codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/multi_agents_spec.rs`, `multi_agents/{spawn,wait,send_input,resume_agent,close_agent}.rs`, `ext/agent/src/lib.rs`, `core/src/config/agent_roles.rs`); `sst/opencode` (`tool/task.ts`, `tool/task.txt`, `agent/agent.ts`, `agent/subagent-permissions.ts`); `openai/openai-agents-python` (`agents/agent.py`, `agent_tool_input.py`); `google/adk-python` (`tools/agent_tool.py`). Claude Code is closed source, so its behavior here is taken from published documentation.

**Not re-verified for this document:** exact line numbers in the two internal harnesses, and the external file contents quoted above, which were read during the research pass rather than re-fetched while writing.
